# Setup
Hopefully by the end of this (meeting/walk-through) your local environment will be done, or well on its way to, installing everything you need to start contributing to the mySidewalk applications!

In the meantime, it would be good to refer back to the resources from the overview for a refresher if need be.

## Applications
- [Docker Toolkit](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.8.3/DockerToolbox-1.8.3.pkg)
- Terminal (Pre-installed. Feel free to install your own alternative)
- Text editor or IDE of your choosing
    - Sublime Text 3
    - Atom
    - Brackets
    - PyCharm
    - WebStorm
- Optional
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Walkthrough
Rather than duplicate _all_ of the documentation that is already in the repository I will merely point you the the README.md at the root of the repository.

`[YOUR REPOSITORY]/README.md`

1. Log into [Unfuddle.com](https://mindmixer.unfuddle.com/projects/2083)
2. Click on "Repositories" in the top navigation
3. Click on the "mySidewalk (mm2)" main repository
4. Click "Show me how to connect", in the upper right hand corner of the page
5. In the small window, scroll down the "Clone" heading. The command and URL should be specified there
6. Clone the repository on your computer in the terminal (You can use your "Documents" folder or anything else. Other people here sometimes use "dev" or "Projects")
7. Navigate to the repository after the cloning has finished and go to the README.md in the top level folder
8. Follow the steps outline in that file to finish the installation/setup process
