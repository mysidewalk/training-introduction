# Setup

Hopefully by the end of this (meeting/walkthrough) your local environment will be on its way to installing everything you need to get up and working!

In the meantime, it would be good to refer back to the resources from the overview for a refresher if need be.

## Local "infrastructure"
- [Vagrant 1.7.1](http://www.vagrantup.com/download-archive/v1.7.1.html)
- [VirtualBox 4.3.14](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3_pre24)
- Terminal (Pre-installed)
- Text editor of your choosing (Sublime Text 3, Atom, Brackets, etc)
- PyCharm (Optional. Will need to talk to Matt about getting a license)
- GitHub Desktop client (Optional)

## Walkthrough
Rather than duplicate _all_ of the documentation that is already in the repository I will merely point you the the README.md at the root of the repository.

`[YOUR REPOSITORY]/README.md`

1. Clone repository
2. Install vagrant + dependencies
3. Make a few updates to your `/etc/hosts` file
4. Run `vagrant up` from the repository
